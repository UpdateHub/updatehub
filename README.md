sending Firmware Over-the-Air (FOTA) updates with maximum security and
efficiency, making your project the center of your attention.

This repository provides the **UpdateHub** agent for Embedded and Industrial
Linux-based devices.

## Getting started

To start using ShellHub, it is suggested that you follow the [Getting
started](https://docs.updatehub.io/quick-starting-with-raspberrypi3/) guide in
the **UpdateHub** documentation.

## Features

The support provided by the **UpdateHub** for the device includes:

- Bootloader upgrade support (U-Boot and GRUB)
- Flash support (NAND, NOR)
- UBIFS support
- Update package signature validation for security
- Automated rollback in case of update fail
- Conditional installation (content, version and custom pattern support)

- HTTP API to control and inquiry the local agent

To learn more about UpdateHub, check out our [documentation](https://docs.updatehub.io).

## Building and testing

The **UpdateHub** agent is developed using Rust programing language due its
focus in safety and system level integration. In case you wish to build it, you
can:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Some tests are marked as ignored because they require user previleges. There's a
Vagrant file that can be used to run them. To run tests on the virtual machine
run:

```bash
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

and inside the SSH session, run:

```bash
sudo -i
cd /vagrant
cargo test
cargo test -- --ignored
```
